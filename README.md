# OpenWithCopyUrlAndroid
Copies Supplied url directly to clipboard when opened with open with.

This was created because some apps dont let you copy links to clipboard instead they launch a browser. You can select this app instead of firefox for example and it will copy the link to your clipboard.

If you open this app without using the open with thing in android it will just show you what is currently in your clipboard and allow you to edit it.
