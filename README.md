# OpenWithCopyUrlAndroid
Copies Supplied url directly to clipboard when opened with open with.

This was created because some apps dont let you copy links to clipboard instead they launch a browser. You can select this app instead of firefox for example and it will copy the link to your clipboard.

## Youtube Link detector
It will detect youtube links and allow you to open them in youtube or vanced. see screenshot 4 bellow. If you don't need this just press "Never show this again" and the app will work as before.

I Added this because android 12 handles youtube links very poorly. It either opens them straight away or not at all. Sometimes I want to open the youtube link in a browser for example.

To reset this just open this app from your launcher and click the "Clear Defaults"
